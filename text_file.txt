After 20 , numbers such as 25 , 50 , 75 , and 100 follow. So long as 1 knows the core number, or the number situated in the tens or hundreds position that determines the general amount, understanding these more complicated numbers won't be difficult. For example 33 is simply 30 plus 3 ; 67 is 60 plus 7 ; and 69 is simply 60 plus 9 .
